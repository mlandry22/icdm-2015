IDCM 2015 Kaggle Competition

"As-is" repository used by team H2O.ai & SRK for the Drawbridge competition for ICDM 2015, hosted by Kaggle. Our team finished in 10th place. The repository was private for the duration of the competition, and I (Mark/mlandry22) use Github primarily to promote discussion. So our code is a bit messy and Github is used more like a fileshare than source control, and the Issues are the primary use of discussing the problem as we work through it.

We are presenting our solution at ICDM 2015, so after the proceedings are available, we will post the PDF we wrote for the conference. That will be a good place to start.

The most interesting part of how we solved this competition, from my point of view, is the features Sudalai created using straight Python loops. These were the most powerful piece of our solution, and worth looking through, if you're still reading this far. Specifically, it's the chain of feature processing python code: steps 2 & 3 from the README.md in the SRK folder.
